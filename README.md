# **WHAT I LEARNED IN  WEEK 1** 


## `MARKDOWN TO HTML` 

Converted Markdown portfolio to HTML. We made a HTML file and copied the markdown equivalent to HTML. We used the live server to preview our progress. 

I commented out the portfolio in markdown on the html file using control + forward slash. This made it easy to easier to copy markdown to html line by line.

## `INTRO TO HTML`

We were exposed to the skeleton structure of HTML. It is very important get the skeleton right in order for the HTML file to be rendered the right way.
 We got used to using closing tags and self closing tags like <img src .../>

 There are some benefits of using HTML instead of markdown like making forms and CSS compliments HTML in order to make websites look pretty.
